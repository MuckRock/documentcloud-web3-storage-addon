# DocumentCloud Add-On

[Please see the Add-On documentation](https://github.com/MuckRock/documentcloud-hello-world-addon/wiki/)

# DocumentCloud Web3 Storage

This Add-On pushes the selected documents to IPFS and the Filecoin network
via the web3.storage service. Once the run is complete, youâ€™ll be given a
working IPFS address for the document, which will make it more resilient from
outages and removals.
